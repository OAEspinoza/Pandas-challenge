# School Analysis
In this report, district-wide standardized test results and spending data was used to analyze trends in school and student performance. Analysis was conducted at three levels:
- District-wide indicators
- School-level indicators
- Inter-School comparisons

This report is organized in two parts: in the first section, select summary tables are listed, including  main district and per-school indicators, and school benchmarking. The second part of this report include major conclusions based on the data analysis. 

## Summaries

### District Summary

### Per-School Summary

In this section the key indicators about each school were generated. Table 2 shows a per-school  summary of all the metrics calculated, including budget per student, average math and reading score, percent of students who passed the math and reading scores (grade 70 or higher), and percent who passed both tests.

### School Benchmarking

A number of comparisons were carried out between the schools in the district, including: 
- Highest and lowest performing schools by percent of overall passing (Table 3 and 4)
- Math and reading score by grade by school (Table 5 and 6)
- Scores by school per capita spending  (Table 7)
- Scores by school size (Table 8)
- Scores by school size for the overall district (Table 9)
- Scores by school type (Table 10)

The top five performing schools by percentage of student who passed both math and reading are, in descending order, Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena (Table 3). Converesly, the lowest performing schools are, in ascending order, Rodriguez, Figeroa, Huang, Hernandez, and Johnson (Tabl 4). The difference between the highest and lowest performing school is 38% (91% and 53%, respectively). The average math score was 83.1 and 76.8 for the top and lowest performing school, respectively. The average score for reading was 84.0 and 80.7 for the top and lowest performing school, respectively.

Table 7 contains the average score indicators by school spending per student. For math and reading, scores increase as the spending per student decreases, for example, the average score for math is 83.4 for schools that spent less than $585 per student and 77.0 for schools that spent $645 to 680. The For reading the difference is not as great (84.0 vs 81.0). The percent of students who passed math and reading also show similar declining trend as spending per student increases; for example 93.5% of students in schools with per capita spending lower than $585 passed math, and this rate was only 66.2% for students in schools with spending between $645-680. The overall passing rate is 90.4% for the lower end of spending, and 53.5 for the schools spending the most.

In Table 8, the score indicators are listed based on school size. In general all testing performance indicators increase in the opposite direction as school size. For example, the average math score for small schools (less than 1000 students) was of 83.8, and 77.7 for large schools (2000 to 5000 students), and for reading the averages were 83.9 and 81.3 for small and large schools, respectively. Similarly, the percent of student passing math and reading, and passing both, followed similar trend. However, there was very small differences in score indicators between small and medium schools, almost suggesting that small and medium schools could be grouped together.

Lastlt, in Table 9 the score indicators were summarized according to school type. There was a marked difference betwenn charter and district schools, with the former performing siginificantly higher.The average math score was 83.5 and 77.0 for charter and district schools, respectively. The difference was not as great in reading, 83.9 vs. 81.0. The percent of students passing math was remarkably higher for charters, 93.6, compared with district schools, 66.5. Similarly, the percent of student passing both math and reading was 90.4 in charters and 53.7 in district schools.

## Conclusions

Based on the data analysis, the following major conclusions can be drawn.
- Spending and test performance: All score indicators, including average math and reading scores, and percent of students passing the tests, have an inverse correlation with per capita spending. In other words, the more a school spends per student, the lower performance it shows in terms of match and reading scores. This finding is somewhat counterintuitive, but further analysis of other factors may help to uncover some causal relationships, including class size, and the number of teachers and staff relative to students.
- School size and test performance: In general, all score indicators suggest an inverse correlation with school size,meaning the smaller the school, the higher the average scores and percent of students passing the standardized tests. However, the difference between small- and medium-sized schools was very small or nonexistent.
-School type and test performance: Charter schools performed significantly better in all score indicators. For example, 94% of the students passed the math test in charter schools compared to 66% in district schools. The difference in the percent of students passing both math and reading was even higher, at 37% (90% vs 54% for charter and district schools, repectively).
