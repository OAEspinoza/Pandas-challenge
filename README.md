# School Analysis
In this report, district-wide standardized test results and spending data was used to analyze trends in school and student performance. Analysis was conducted at three levels:
- District-wide indicators
- School-level indicators
- Inter-School comparisons

Major results and conclusions are detailed in the following sections.

### School Benchmarking

A number of comparisons were carried out between the schools in the district, including: 
- Highest and lowers performing schools by percent of overall passing (average math and reading scores above 70)
- Math and reading score by grade by school
- Scores by school per capita spending 
- Scores by school size (by school and for the overall district)
- Scores by school type

## Conclusions

Based on the data analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn.
- All score indicators, including average math and reading scores, and percent of students passing, have an inverse correlation with per capita spending. In other words, the more a school spends per student, the lower performance it shows in terms of match and reading scores. This finding is somewhat counterintuitive, but further analysis of other factors at play may help to uncover causal relationships.
- Regarding school size and standard test performance, all score indicators show an inverse correlation with school size,meaning the smaller the school, the higher the average scores and percent of students passing the standardized tests. However, the difference between small- and medium-sized schools was almost negligible.
- Charter schools perform significantly better in all score indicators. For example, 94% of the students passed the math test in charter schools compared to 66% in district schools. The difference in the percent of students passing both math and reading was even higher, at 37%.
